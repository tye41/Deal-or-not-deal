# Deal-or-not-deal
If you run the main.py, 26 boxes and possible grand(>=50000 dollars) will be displayed on the interface. The money in the box is from 1 cent to 5 million dollars. The first box you click will be your box and it won't be opened. Imagine a banker is looking at you, and he will provide his deal some times. Each time you receive the bankdeal, you can sell your box and gain the money. Otherwise, you can reject the deal and keep opening rest of the boxes. Pay attention! Banker will provide his final deal when there are only three boxes left. If you reject his final deal, the money in the box will be your final gain.

Have fun!
